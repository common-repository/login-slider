Add a slider to your login page to turn it from boring to something exciting and useful.

== Description ==
One of the most underutilized pages on any WordPress site is the login screen. Our Login Slider plugin changes that. Now you can have a half screen announcement slider next to the traditional login box. Each slide can have a link to any URL which makes it fantastic for directing users to sales or other important parts of your site.

You can also customize the login form by adding in your logo, changing colors and so on. It\'s all handled inside the customizer so adding items is a piece of cake.
